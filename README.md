## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation
- Clone the repo
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/YuqiGuo105/Portfolio.git
  ```

- Install NPM packages
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

- Set up environment variables in '.env'
  ```

  EMAIL_PASS=YOUR_PASS
  EMAIL_TO=TO_USER
  ```

### Supabase setup

1. **Create a project** at [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com) and copy the "Project URL" and "anon" API key from the _Project Settings ‚Üí API_ page. Paste them into the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` variables shown above.
2. **Create the `visitor_logs` table** (used by `/api/track`) by running the SQL below in the Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql
   create table if not exists public.visitor_logs (
     id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
     created_at timestamptz default now(),
     local_time timestamptz,
     event text,
     ip text,
     ua text,
     country text,
     region text,
     city text,
     latitude double precision,
     longitude double precision
   );
   ```
3. **Enable Row Level Security (RLS)** on the table and add a policy to allow inserts from the anon key:
   ```sql
   alter table public.visitor_logs enable row level security;

   create policy "Allow inserts from anon" on public.visitor_logs
     for insert
     to anon
     with check (true);
   ```
4. Deploy the updated environment variables to Vercel (or your hosting provider) so the API route can access Supabase in production.

- Running the project
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
