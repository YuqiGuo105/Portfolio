# Yuqi Guo's Portfolio Platform

A modern Next.js portfolio application for showcasing projects, blogs, CV, visitor analytics, and an AI-powered portfolio assistant. The site is designed as both a personal portfolio and a microservice-backed engineering platform, with serverless frontend APIs, Supabase-backed content storage, Kafka-based event fan-out, OpenSearch search, pgvector RAG indexing, notification delivery, and a real-time visitor analytics pipeline.

**Production:** https://www.yuqi.site

## Admin / MCP Operations

The admin page is the protected operator surface for the portfolio platform. It
centralizes content management, subscriber and notification views, visitor logs,
agent conversations, cost guardrails, and MCP-style operations behind Supabase
authentication and an allow-listed admin identity.

The operate console lets an admin issue natural-language platform commands.
Read-only requests can run immediately; write operations such as publish,
reindex, retry, alert policy changes, and send-test flows are staged first as a
confirmation-required action before the backend tool executes.

Visitor alert rules are evaluated by the analytics platform and delivered through
the notification pipeline. The email below shows the end-to-end operational
alert received by an administrator after a configured regional rule was
triggered.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the frontend locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js
* npm

Install the latest npm globally if needed:

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

## Supabase Setup

1. Create a Supabase project at [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com).
2. Copy the Project URL and anon public API key from **Project Settings → API**.
3. Add them to `.env` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
4. Copy the `service_role` key and set it as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
5. Open the Supabase SQL Editor.
6. Run the schema and RLS policy script from `create_sql.txt` in the repository root.
7. Confirm that required tables, policies, and server-side access patterns are configured correctly.

## Usage

* Browse projects, blogs, and portfolio details.
* Use the contact form to send messages to the portfolio owner.
* Use the AI chat widget to ask questions about the portfolio.
* Use the Admin Dashboard to edit portfolio content.
* Use Supabase as the source of truth for editable content.
