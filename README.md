### Supabase setup

1. **Create a project** at [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com) and copy the **Project URL** and **anon (public) API key** from _Project Settings ‚Üí API_. Paste them into `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in your `.env`.

2. **Apply the database schema and RLS policies.** Open the Supabase SQL editor and run the contents of `create_sql.txt` located at the root of this repository. This script creates all required tables (e.g., `visitor_logs`) and configures the necessary Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
